# Speaker Support

While new and first time speakers will get the most benefit out of a speaker support program for your conference, veteran speakers may also benefit from the opportunity to hone their skills and polish their talks. It also helps to build your speakers as a community, and to help establish your conference’s brand. The following workshops can be run as meetups in the run up to your conference. It’s suggested that you partner with local companies to host the meetups, and potentially partner with other local conferences who match your conference’s ethos to signal boost and share the load.

## The “How To Apply To A Conference” workshop

Ideally you should run this workshop early in the CFP period for your conference. This workshop can be run as a three hour evening event, or it can easily be adapted into an all*day event. This works best with a relatively small number of attendees (less than 20) and a relatively high proportion of facilitators (at least one for every four or five attendees).
 The following is how the event has been run in Belfast, and can easily be modified to fit your preference. Slides that accompanied this version of the event [can be found here](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/conference-applications-workshoppptx/259546391). Handouts summarizing the slides that can be printed out and given to the attendees [can be found here](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/how-to-apply-to-conferences-handout-sheets/268624737).

### Part 1: What does applying to a conference involve?

To set the ground, explain to the attendees the typical structure of a conference application:
* The title
* The description
* The outline (if required)
* The bio

Explain to them how different conferences look for different things, and how they should either come up with an idea that fits the conference they want to speak at, or find a conference that fits the idea they have. It is important to look at previous iterations of a conference to see what they’re like, and to carefully read their guidelines.

### Part 2: Coming up with ideas

The second part involves helping the participants to come up with ideas. One way to do this is by asking themselves:
What do you care about?
* What have you done?
* What do you know that people aren’t talking about?
* What do you wish people would talk about?
* What was the last tech blog post/presentation you disagreed with?
* What was the last tech blog post/presentation you disagreed with?
* What do you wish someone had told you a year ago?
* What do you want to learn so that you can do a talk about it?

At this point you should break the workshop up into small groups for a while, each led by a facilitator, and have them work through coming up with ideas. Even if they don’t come up with a good idea, encourage them to have something to work on for the rest of the meetup.

### Part 3: Writing The Pitch

Once people have an idea, the next part is to create a compelling description of it (a “pitch”). Explain to the attendees that this will both need to convince the CFP panel to accept the talk, and to convince the attendees on the day to come to the talk. One way to do this is a structured approach:
* Describe the landscape:
    * What’s the background to your talk? 
    * What is the problem you are addressing?
* Explain your insight
    * What’s your talk about?
    * What solution are you bringing?
* Offer people takeaways
    * What will people get out of attending?
    * Why should they come to your talk?
    *  What will they learn?

Of these, the most important part is the takeaways. People attend conferences to gain value from these talks, so you need to show that your talk will give this value. Takeaways are also very important when you write your talk * they are a promise you have made and must deliver on.

At this point you should take a second breakout. Split up into the same group and talk through your ideas in this structure. Think about what takeaways you can offer to people.

### Part 4: Writing Your Bio

The last part of the workshop is about writing your program bio, which is usually required as part of the application. The key thing is to show that you are the right person to give this talk, and that you will be an interesting speaker, without making it look like a CV. 

The slides/handouts include a set of questions (such as “what do you want people to talk to you about?”) to help drive out bio content. If time permits, you can have a final breakout session to go through these.

### Conclusion

You should close out the workshop by going through a selection of conferences that are good places for first*timers to apply to. 

## The “Supporting Speakers” workshops

Once people have been accepted, you should run a series to help them put their talks together. This consists of two sets of workshops.

### A “Talk Preparation” meetup

This is a traditional meetup where an experienced speaker leads the audience through a presentation on how to create a talk. You should ideally get someone who is well known and respected in the local community.

### Guided Practice/Feedback Sessions

These are looser in format, and you may run several (we usually run three). The idea is that people can bring along their talks, whatever state they are in, to try them out in front of a friendly audience, and to get feedback. They may have slides, they may not have any and just be working through the structure. You should have experienced speakers as facilitators to give constructive feedback, but the other speakers should also give their opinions if they want. A couple of pointers:
* A great way to break the ice is for one of the facilitators to lead off with their half*finished talk.
* Time and numbers are a concern. Each person will probably need around half an hour each, so if there are a lot of people looking to get feedback you may need to break out into multiple groups. Bear this in mind when choosing a venue.
